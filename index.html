<p>In the summer of 2011, I moved from Southern California to St. Louis, Mo to attend Webster University. I had never been to the state and knew close to nothing about the city. One of the best ways I got acquainted with Saint Louis was through the jobs I've held and the incredible peoeple I've been lucky to work with. Each experience showed me a new side of the city, and before I knew it I was calling this place home. </p>

    My first off campus job in college was for the Red Bull Wings Team in Saint Louis. Prior to this I had spent most of my time in the Webster Groves area, and did not have many opportunities to explore the city around me. Working for Red Bull changed all this, and opened my eyes to just how great Saint Louis could be. My job was to organize "missions" that fell under varying categories such as sports, work, education, etc. We would then drive the Red Bull Mini Cooper to previously researched locations and events to engage consumers in trials of free Red Bull. The job was dynamic and exciting, and pretty soon I was in the know of all of the events going on around the city. I would drive everywhere from downtwon to Vetta Sports out in the county. This was the first time I was able to engage with dfferent people in all of St. Louis' neighorhoods, and is what finally allowed me to feel at home in this city. I am forever grateful to Red Bull for the opportunity to not only advance my career, but for also opening my eyes to how great this city can be.

    Drunken Fish was my first restaurant job in college and was where I first learned how to bartend. This job put me out of my comfort zone and helped build my confidence in interacting with people. While at this job I got extremely familiar with the Central West End and the Forest Park area of Saint Louis and worked with people that would become some of my best friends. This was also my first introduction to the Saint Louis food and beverage scene, something I quickly became enamored with. Most people think of larger cities on either coast when naming top food spots in America, but I soon found that the people in the industry right here in St. Louis were just as passionate and innovative. In the past seven years i've lived here I have seen tremendous growth and talent, especially from people my age, they are transforming this city through food and drink and this shared passion is something that has made Saint Louis my home.

    While completing my degree in Marketing/Advertising Communications at Webster University, I interned with local company Thinktank PR downtown. I had never spent much time downtown until this point, and was soon muh more familiar with the home of the Arch. Our office was located on the riverfront, so I spent many lunch breaks brainstorming around the arch grounds. This job introduced me to the creative minds of the city who were also passionate about marketing and branding. I was surprised by the number of locally owned businesses, and realized that was just another thing that made St. Louis so special. Working on accounts such as McAllister's Bakery and Kraftig allowed me to meet and collaboarte with entrepeneurs who strive to build up this city and keep things local. It was around this time that I began entertaining the idea of stayig in Saint Louis after graduation instead of going back to California.

  After my first bartending job at Drunken fish, I was completely hooked on being a part of Saint Louis' food and beverage scene. I started bartending at Gamlin Whiskey House under some talented vets in the Saint Louis industry. They taught me so much, but more importantly I got to meet so many people of all ages who love this city and are invested in innovating it. This passion persuaded me to be as involved as possible. While I was here, I was lucky enough to work several events all over the city and soon realized I had become a staple in several neighborhoods. I had people not only recognize me, but had built an entire community based off my work connections and strangers soon became friends. I now had an extended family in a state that was once foreign to me. My friends from this job also introduced me new watering holes in places such as Cherokee Street, and South City. I was spending time in places that I had never given a second thought too and pretty soon Saint Louis felt like my own backyard, never too far from a friendly familiar face.

<p>
    My infatuation with the local food and drink scene went noticed by Alyson Mace, owner and publisher of the local food publication, Sauce Magazine. I knew her from my several years as a bartender, and even won a competition she wasa guest judge for. Small talk over our shared passion for this city, and its talented chef's turned into an opportunity to intern for her. I applied and became an editorial intern for Sauce, where I had an invaluable behind the scenes experience with how a locally owned publications runs. Not only did I get to write and research for the magazine, I also got to meet just about everybody who's been a key player in enhancing Saint Louis' dining scene. I soon became the go to for all my friends on where to eat and drink in the city. If it was noteworthy, I knew about it. I got hired on as a marketing manager, and with the promotion came an intimate relationship with many Saint Louis business owners. I got to know them and their stories, and felt just how much they loved their neighborhoods. Food and drink became a way to bond with St. Louisans and offered a completely new way to experience familiar spaces. Streets stopped being spaces of the city, and instead I identified areas by what food was on that block and who owned it. This gave St. Louis a personality in my mind, a true essence of hard work and love.

<p>My most recent job at Yellowbelly has drawn the most media attention that I have been a part of, and has taught me that no one should underestimate this city, no matter how unassuming it is. Tim Wiggins and Travis Howard are two people in the local service industry who have recieved a lot of attention for the success of Retreat Gastropub, and the two teamed up with San Diego Chef Richard Blais to open up a seafood and tiki concept in Saint Louis. Blais is famous for his win on Top Chef, and has since become an on tv personality and owner of Juniper and Ivy in San Diego. Working with this talented team has pushed my skills and allowed me to be a part of an innovative space in the city. The idea is to show people that you can have high quality drinks and high quality sea food despite being in the midwest.     </p>
